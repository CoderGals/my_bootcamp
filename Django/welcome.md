# Django Level III

## Welcome!


By this point you know how to make a robust, multi-app project.
You can take advantage of Django's MTV structure to split your app into conceptual chunks. You have skinny controllers. You can build a database using Models and forward engineer it with migrations. You know how to use sessions and Django Template Engine.

You're a full stack web developer!

Still, Django has plenty more to offer. In Level III, we'll be covering four major topics.

Forms
The built-in Auth model
AJAX with Django
Class Based Views
Forms allow us to generate forms once and insert them into our html files in a single line of code! We can also auto-generate forms based on our Models.

The built-in Auth model takes care of user authentication in its entirety -- registration, login, logout, password changes, and validations. Its downside is that it is somewhat inflexible in terms of what fields it has, so in the second part of this section we'll go over how to customize the Auth model with your own fields, keeping all the work that Django is doing for us.

Next we will incorporate AJAX, allowing us to make super responsive webpages on which we can make database queries and updates without needing to refresh or change the page, and our page's content can update dynamically too!

Finally, we'll look into Class Based Views. This is a way of taking DRY to the next level, so we can leverage the power of inheritance and set up default variables with RESTful syntax.

Make sense? Let's dive in!
